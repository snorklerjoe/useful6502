# Build Options

## Setup

I have a modified version of pk2cmd installed on my machine, and the makefile has been given the location of `xc_cc` on my machine.  
If I still have `sudo` in my `Makefile`, it means I have still been too lazy to get the udev rules to work correctly without it.

## Commands

Run `make cycle` to clean, compile, flash, verify, and release the reset pin.
